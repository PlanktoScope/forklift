A simpler, easier, and safer way to manage application/system services on embedded Linux systems.

Note: this is still an experimental prototype and is not yet ready for general use.

## Introduction

Forklift is a software deployment and configuration system providing a simpler, easier, and safer mechanism for updating, reconfiguring, recomposing, and extending browser apps, network services, and system services on single-computer systems (such as a Raspberry Pi or a laptop), especially computers embedded in open-source scientific instruments. While Forklift can also be used in other contexts, it makes tradeoffs specific to the ways in which many open-source scientific instruments need to be deployed and operated (e.g. intermittent internet access, independent administration by individual people, decentralized management & customization).

For end-users operating open-source instruments with application services (e.g. network APIs or browser-based interfaces) and/or system services (for e.g. data backups/transfer, hardware support, computer networking, monitoring, etc.), Forklift aims to provide an experience for installing and uninstalling software similar what is achieved by app stores for mobile phones - but with more user control. Forklift also simplifies the process of keeping software up-to-date and the process of rolling software back to older versions if needed; this reduces the need to (for example) re-flash a Raspberry Pi's SD card with a new OS image just to update the application software running on the instrument while still ensuring that the resulting state of the system will be valid.

For open-hardware project developers, Forklift enables Linux-based devices and [appliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_appliance) to be retrofitted and extended with an open ecosystem of containerized software - device-specific or general-purpose, project-maintained or third-party. Forklift also provides an incremental path for migrating project-specific application/system services into management by Forklift so that they can be configured, distributed, installed, and replaced by users just like any other app managed by Forklift - i.e. with version control and easy upgrades/rollbacks. The [PlanktoScope](https://www.planktoscope.org/), an open-source microscope for quantitative imaging of plankton, uses Forklift as foundational infrastructure for software releases, deployment, and extensibility in the PlanktoScope's custom Linux distro based on the Raspberry Pi OS; and Forklift was designed specifically to solve the software maintenance and operations challenges experienced in the PlanktoScope project.

For indie software developers and sysadmins familiar with DevOps and cloud-native principles, Forklift is just a GitOps-inspired system which is small and simple enough to work beyond the cloud - using Docker Compose to avoid the architectural complexity, operational overhead, and memory usage of even minimal Kubernetes distributions like k0s; and (in a future version of Forklift) enabling deployment of system files, binaries, and systemd units from configuration files version-controlled in Git repositories. Thus, Forklift allows hassle-free management of software configurations on one or more machines with only occasional internet access and no specialized ops or platform team.


### Values & Governance

Forklift is guided by the following values for infrastructural software in the PlanktoScope software:

- Autonomy: It must empower people to make their own decisions specific to their needs and contexts, and to exercise full control of their ops independent of the PlanktoScope projectâ€™s longevity.
- Compatibility: It must work well together with legacy systems such as the PlanktoScope distro, with the diverse programs which might be managed by it, and with the variety of operational contexts for PlanktoScope deployment. When compatibility is infeasible, incremental migration must be feasible.
- Integrity: It must be trustworthy and reliable in its behavior. It must not corrupt the state of systems built around it. It must be honest to users about what it is doing.
- Productivity: It must help people, teams, and communities to efficiently develop, operate, and maintain their projects; including both the PlanktoScope project and novel extensions and uses for the PlanktoScope. It must be easy to learn, fast enough to use in iterative prototyping, and reliable enough to use in production. It must minimize any complexity and novelty which would distract people from their higher-level goals.
- Thoughtfulness: Its design must be rigorous, deliberate, and considerate of how it will impact people. We must not commit to new features or changes in system behavior until we thoroughly understand their consequences.
- Transparency: Its architecture and behavior must be sufficiently simple and easy to observe, fully explain, fully understand, troubleshoot, and learn from.

Currently, design and development of Forklift prioritizes the needs of the PlanktoScope community. Thus, for now decisions will be made by the PlanktoScope software's maintainer as a "benevolent dictator"/"mad scientist" in consultation with the PlanktoScope community in online meetings and discussion channels open to the entire community. This will remain the governance model of Forklift while it's still an experimental tool and still only used for the standard/default version of the PlanktoScope's operating system, in order to ensure that Forklift develops in a cohesive way consistent with the values listed above and with the PlanktoScope community's use-case for Forklift. Once Forklift starts being used for delivering/maintaining variants of the PlanktoScope's operating system, for integration of third-party apps from the PlanktoScope community, or for software configuration by ordinary users, then governance of the [github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift) repository will transition from benevolent dictatorship into the PlanktoScope project's [consensus-based proposals process](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/proposals). In the meantime, we encourage anyone who is interested in using/adapting Forklift to fork this repository for experimentation and/or to [create new discussion posts in this repository](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift/discussions/new/choose), though we can't make any guarantees about the stability of any APIs or about our capacity to address any external code contributions or feature requests.

If other projects beyond the PlanktoScope community decide to use Forklift as part of their software delivery/deployment infrastructure, we can talk about expanding governance of Forklift beyond the PlanktoScope community - feel free to start a discussion in this repository's GitHub Discussions forum.

### Architecture

As a software deployment/configuration system, Forklift consists of:

- The `forklift` tool, a single self-contained executable file which provides user interfaces (currently only a command-line interface, though a browser app is also planned) for managing the configuration of apps deployed on a Docker host.
- The Forklift specifications (in the [`docs/specs` directory](./docs/specs)), which describe the syntax, structure, and semantics of configuration files and Git repositories used by the `forklift` tool.
- Publicly-hosted Git repositories (e.g. on GitHub) complying with the Forklift specifications.
- Container image registries (e.g. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages)) complying with the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).

## Usage

### Download/install `forklift`

First, you will need to download the `forklift` tool, which is available as a single self-contained executable file. You should visit this repository's [releases page](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/forklift/releases/latest) and download an archive file for your platform and CPU architecture; for example, on a Raspberry Pi 4, you should download the archive named `forklift_{version number}_linux_arm.tar.gz` (where the version number should be substituted). You can extract the `forklift` binary from the archive using a command like:
```
tar -xzf forklift_{version number}_{os}_{cpu architecture}.tar.gz forklift
```

Then you may need to move the `forklift` binary into a directory in your system path, or you can just run the `forklift` binary in your current directory (in which case you should replace `forklift` with `./forklift` in the example commands listed below), or you can just run the `forklift` binary by its absolute/relative path (in which case you should replace `forklift` with the absolute/relative path of the binary in the example commands listed below).

### Deploy a published pallet

Once you have forklift, you will need to clone a pallet and apply it to your Docker host. For example, you can clone the latest unstable version (on the `edge` branch) of the [`github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard`](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard) pallet using the command:
```
forklift plt clone github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@edge
```

Then you will need to download everything required by your local pallet into your local cache. You can download the necessary requirements using the command:
```
forklift plt cache-all
```

Then you will need to apply the package deployments (as configured by your local pallet) onto your Docker host. You can apply the deployments using the command (note that you need `sudo -E` unless you are running the Docker in [rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) or your user is in [the `docker` group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)):
```
sudo -E forklift plt apply
```

If your user is in the `docker` group, then you can just run a single command which does all three steps above (this way you don't have to run those three commands each time you want to get a newer version and apply it):
```
forklift plt switch github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard@edge
```

### Work on a development pallet

First, you will need to make/download a pallet somewhere on your local file system. For example, you can use `git` to clone the latest unstable version (on the `edge` branch) of the [`github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard`](https://github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard) pallet using the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/PlanktoScope/pallet-standard
```

Then you will need to download/install the `forklift` tool (see instructions in the ["Download/install forklift"](#downloadinstall-forklift) section above). Once you have `forklift`, you can run commands using the `dev plt` subcommand; if `forklift` is in your system path, you can simply run commands within the directory containing your development pallet, or any subdirectory of it. For example, if your development pallet is at `/home/pi/dev/pallet-standard`, you can run the following commands to see some information about your development pallet:

```
cd /home/pi/dev/pallet-standard
forklift dev plt show
```

You can also run the command from anywhere else on your filesystem by specifying the path of your development pallet. For example, if your forklift binary is in `/home/pi`, you can run any the following sets of commands to see the same information about your development pallet:

```
cd /home/pi/
./forklift dev --cwd ./dev/pallet-standard plt show
```

```
cd /etc/
/home/pi/forklift dev --cwd /home/pi/dev/pallet-standard plt show
```

You can also use the `forklift dev plt add-repo` command to add additional Forklift repositories to your development pallet, and to change the versions of Forklift repositories already added to your development pallet.

You can also run commands like `forklift dev plt cache-all` and `sudo -E forklift dev plt apply` (with appropriate values in the `--cwd` flag if necessary) to download the Forklift repositories specified by your development pallet into your local cache and deploy the packages provided by those repositories according to the configuration in your development pallet. This is useful if, for example, you want to make some experimental changes to your development pallet and test them on your local machine before committing and pushing those changes onto GitHub.

Finally, you can run the `forklift dev plt check` command to check the pallet for any problems, such as violations of resource constraints between package deployments.

You can also override cached repos with repos from your filesystem by specifying one or more directories containing one or more repos; then the repos in those directories will be used instead of the respective repos from the cache, regardless of repo version. For example:

```
cd /home/pi/
/home/pi/forklift dev --cwd /home/pi/dev/pallet-standard plt --repos /home/pi/forklift/dev/device-pkgs check
```
